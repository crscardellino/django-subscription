My goal for this is flexibility without too much structure. Contrast this to:

https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream

Which in my opinion is too restrictive in its whole actor/verb setup and
seems to have unrealistic performance for even medium-size websites (see
their user_stream method and imagine 60k users and 500k notifications)

I also don't like how Subscription frameworks and Notification frameworks tend
to be packaged separately. I can't imagine one without the other, so here's both.

SUBSCRIBING:

Subscription.objects.subscribe(user,content_object) # Subscribes a user

EMITTING:

Subscription.objects.emit("Some thing happened to this object!", subscribers_of=content_object)

The args/kwargs to emit() are more or less shuttled straight to the SUBSCRIPTION_BACKEND(s),
which is a dict in your settings.py like:

SUBSCRIPTION_BACKENDS = {
    'email': 'myproject.subscription_backends.Email',
    'redis': 'myproject.subscription_backends.Redis',
}

Writing a backend:

You can subclass subscription.backends.BaseBackend. Right now the options are:

text - required - The message to post to subscribers
subscribers_of - Gets the recipients from the Subscription model
dont_send_to - Useful for supressing comment messages to their own author, for example
send_only_to - Useful for other things I guess
actor_display_self - Usually 'You', in case you want to emit a notice
actor_display_other - Usually 'Some Person' <has comment on...>
actor - Who's doing the emitting? How we figure out the above
format_kwargs - applied to 'text' arg (above) via string.Formatter
**kwargs - Passed onto your backend subclass in case you need more info


#  A common activity stream setup powered via redis could look like:


# Backend

from subscription import backends
from .utils import Redis

class ActStream(backends.BaseBackend):
    def emit(self, user, text, **kwargs):
        conn = Redis()
        item = json.dumps((time.mktime(datetime.datetime.now().timetuple()),text))
        conn.lpush("actstream::%s::undelivered" % user.pk,item)


#  Retrieving messages


def user_stream(user, clear_undelivered=False):
    def deserialize_stream(stream):
        stream_redux = []
        if not stream:
            return stream_redux
        for s in stream:
            s = json.loads(s)
            stream_redux.append((datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(s[0]),s[1]))
        return stream_redux

    conn = Redis()
    if clear_undelivered:
        undelivered = conn.lrange("actstream::%s::undelivered" % user.pk,0,-1)
        if undelivered:
            for u in reversed(undelivered): # Flip em around so recent is done last
                conn.lpush("actstream::%s::unacknowledged" % user.pk,u)
        conn.delete("actstream::%s::undelivered" % user.pk)

    groups = {}
    groups['acknowledged'] = deserialize_stream(conn.lrange("actstream::%s::acknowledged" % (user.pk),0,-1))
    groups['unacknowledged'] = deserialize_stream(conn.lrange("actstream::%s::unacknowledged" % (user.pk),0,-1))
    groups['undelivered'] = deserialize_stream(conn.lrange("actstream::%s::undelivered" % (user.pk),0,-1))
    return groups
